# arXiv Paper Classifier
**AI-Powered Research Paper Categorization Platform**

## Overview
arXiv Paper Classifier is a full-stack web application that automatically classifies research papers into academic domains using machine learning. Users submit a paper’s title and abstract, and the system predicts the most relevant research category with confidence scores.

The project integrates modern frontend design, secure authentication, admin management, and a CatBoost-based machine learning model into a single end-to-end system.
